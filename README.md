# Python Playground

Welcome to the Python Playground! This repository contains a collection of examples that demonstrate the basics of Python programming. The examples are designed to be simple, easy to understand, and serve as a starting point for learning the Python language.

Here is a summary of what you can find in this repository:
- Examples of the print() statement and its usage
- Basic data types and variable manipulation
- Flow control statements (if/else, for loops, while loops)
- Function and class definitions
- Common built-in modules and their usage

The examples are accompanied by unit tests that check the output of the examples to ensure they are working correctly. This repository is intended for anyone who is new to Python and wants to learn the basics of the language in a hands-on, interactive way.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy coding!
